I like creating things.
Below is a list of the things I am most proud of making, along with
short descriptions and pictures. Most of them are woodworking projects.

### Wooden Containers

One of my friends is a succulent hoarder, so I made her a cup she could use
as a flowerpot. Mainly maple, it has strips of walnut inlaid for some
additional visual flair. [pic1](/images/flowerpot_done.jpg) [pic2](/images/flowerpot_drillpress.jpg) [pic3](/images/flowerpot_oct.jpg) [pic4](/images/flowerpot_rough.jpg)  [pic5](/images/flowerpot_raw.jpg)

A second, very similar project was a pencil holder I made for myself. Like the
flowerpot, I had to make it without the use of a lathe. This presented a
challenge that had to be solved with either an extensive amount of hand filing,
or an inappropriate use of a drill press. [pic1](/images/pencil_holder_finished.jpg) [pic2](/images/pencil_holder_rough.jpg)

A third project along the same lines was a wooden box I made for storing small
items in my dorm room. Instead of making a traditional six sized box, I chose
to create one massive block and to hollow out the inner space. This gives it
a very rugged and handmade look that I love. [pic1](/images/box1_closed.jpg) [pic2](/images/box1_scooped.jpg) [pic3](/images/box1_forstner.jpg) [pic3](/images/box1_block.jpg) 


### Flagstone Patio

I helped a friend of mine with a home improvement project. They wanted to
extend their outdoor patio by around 30%, so we bought the materials ourselves
and got to work. Precisely cutting flagstones is made difficult by the fact
that the saw used weighs around 20 pounds and has to be worked close to the
ground. Cutting curves is a skill that takes quite a few cuts to become familiar with and overall layout of the stones is deceptively tricky. [pic1](/images/patio.jpg)


### Wax Stamp

After watching too much Game of Thrones, I became obsessed with the wax stamps
the characters would attach to their personal letters. I desperately wanted to
be able to melt down some wax, stamp it with my personal initials, and adorn
my letters with proof of origin. I used Blender to model the stamp head, and
then sent off the final file to a company in New York for it to be 3d printed.
I crafted the handle out of maple and walnut, and once assembled, it looks
great! [pic1](/images/stamp_final.jpg) [pic2](/images/stamp_wax.jpg)

### Wooden Trinkets

Here are some flags I made as christmas gifts. [pic1](/images/all_flags.jpg)

Here are some blocks I made for a friend's newborn child. [pic1](/images/blocks_stacked.jpg) [pic2](/images/blocks_glue.jpg) [pic3](/images/blocks2.jpg)

I made two laser etched maps (Palo Alto and New York) as well as a desk toy
for a friend that goes to UCLA. [pic1](/images/desk_maps.jpg)


### Cutting Boards

All woodworkers go through the rite of passage that is making cutting boards
for their friends/family/friends-of-family-at-request-of-their-mother. [pic1](/images/cuttingboard1.jpg) [pic2](/images/cuttingboard2.jpg) [pic3](/images/cuttingboard3.jpg) 

This one is special as it is an end-grain board, sometimes referred to as a "butchers block". I saw someone in the woodshop discard some great maple
offcuts, and I asked if I could use them. I created a basic pattern by injecting
some walnut between the maple pieces.
