I find joy in creating things, whether it be physical, digital, or literary.
Below is a list of the things I am most proud of making, along with
short descriptions and pictures. Most of them are woodworking projects.

### Flowerpot / Chalice

One of my friends is a succulent hoarder, so I made her a cup she could use
as a flowerpot. Mainly maple, it has strips of walnuts inlaid for some
additional visual flair. [pic1](/images/flowerpot_done.jpg) [pic2](/images/flowerpot_drillpress.jpg) [pic3](/images/flowerpot_oct.jpg) [pic4](/images/flowerpot_rough.jpg)  [pic5](/images/flowerpot_raw.jpg)

A second, very similar project was a pencil holder I made for myself. Like the
flowerpot, I had to make it without the use of a lathe. This presented a
challenge that had to be solved with either an extensive amount of hand filing,
or an inappropriate use of a drill press. [pic1](/images/pencil_holder_finished.jpg) [pic2](/images/pencil_holder_rough.jpg)


### Flagstone Patio

I helped a friend of mine with a home improvement project. They wanted to
extend their outdoor patio by around 30%, so we bought the materials ourselves
and got to work. Precisely cutting flagstones is made difficult by the fact
that the saw used weighs around 20 pounds and has to be worked close to the
ground. Cutting curves is a skill that takes quite a few cuts to become familiar with and overall layout of the stones is deceptively tricky. [pic1](/images/patio.jpg)
