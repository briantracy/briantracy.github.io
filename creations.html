Below is a list of the things I am most proud of making, along with short descriptions and pictures. Most of them are woodworking projects.</p><h3>Flowerpot / Chalice</h3><p>One of my friends is a succulent hoarder, so I made her a cup she could use as a flowerpot. Mainly maple, it has strips of walnuts inlaid for some additional visual flair. <a href="/images/flowerpot_done.jpg">pic1</a> <a href="/images/flowerpot_drillpress.jpg">pic2</a> <a href="/images/flowerpot_oct.jpg">pic3</a> <a href="/images/flowerpot_rough.jpg">pic4</a> <a href="/images/flowerpot_raw.jpg">pic5</a></p><p>A second, very similar project was a pencil holder I made for myself. Like the flowerpot, I had to make it without the use of a lathe. This presented a challenge that had to be solved with either an extensive amount of hand filing, or an inappropriate use of a drill press. <a href="/images/pencil_holder_finished.jpg">pic1</a> <a href="/images/pencil_holder_rough.jpg">pic2</a></p><h3>Flagstone Patio</h3><p>I helped a friend of mine with a home improvement project. They wanted to extend their outdoor patio by around 30%, so we bought the materials ourselves and got to work. Precisely cutting flagstones is made difficult by the fact that the saw used weighs around 20 pounds and has to be worked close to the ground. Cutting curves is a skill that takes quite a few cuts to become familiar with and overall layout of the stones is deceptively tricky. <a href="/images/patio.jpg">pic1</a></p></main><footer>Last modified May 16 01:01:27 2020</footer></body></html>
