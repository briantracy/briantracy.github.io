<h3>Creations</h3>
<p>I enjoy making things out of wood (and other materials). The linked images are all hi-res jpegs and are roughly 1.7MB each.</p>

<h4>Children's Blocks</h4>
<p>Made for a friend of mine who is having a kid. Walnut and maple, finished with mineral oil. Absolutely no sharp edges or corners and all of the materials are food safe.</p>

<h4>Walnut and Basswood box</h4>
<p>I wanted to spice a classic box by laminating a strip of walnut into the center. In addition, I went with a hollowed out design as apposed to a six-face approach.</p>

<h4>Wooden Flags</h4>
<p>Christmas presents for my family. Scale models of flags made of basswood. Engravings were made with a laser cutter.</p>

<h4>Cutting Boards</h4>
<p>Most of my initial projects were cutting boards for my mom and her friends. Commonly featured woods are maple, walnut, cherry, and alder. I am a huge fan of mineral oil as a finish and it works great for cutting boards because it is food safe <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.878">[SOURCE]</a>. It looks especially good on dark woods like walnut. </p>

<h4>Screw Driver and Checker Plate</h4>
<p>This was made in my mechanical technology class. It was my first experience with a Bridgeport mill and metalworking in general. One set of holes is tapped. The screw driver started out as dowel stock and was forged using an induction furnace.</p>

<h4>Intro Whittling</h4>
<p>My first shot at whittling. I started out with a square .75" x .75" stock and was aiming to make a chess pawn. I couldn't get the centering correct, so it morphed into something else.</p>
