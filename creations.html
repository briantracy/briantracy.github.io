<h1>Creations</h1>
    <p>I enjoy making things out of wood (and other materials).</p>

<h4>Flagstone Patio</h4>
<p>I made this patio with a friend's dad over the course of several days.
First, the region was enclosed with a metal band to separate the stone from
the grass. Next, gravel was laid to support the stone. The stones were roughly 1.5in - 2in in width (around 1700lbs were used). Once the stones were layed out in their rough positions, they all had to be edged with a 16" diamond
cutoff saw. This was the most difficult part of the job and was both physically and mentally taxing. Once all the stones were cut, they had to be leveled
both locally (the interfaces between stones) and globally across the patio.</p>

<h4>Desk Toy + Maps</h4>
<p>I found a website that allowed me to view maps without the labels, so I took
some pictures from here and then image traced them in Adobe Illustrator. The resulting
vector path can then be sent to a laser cutter to be engraved.</p>

<h4>Flower Pot / Pencil Pot</h4>
<p>Made for a friend of mine, a budding botanist. Basswood and Walnut. "Turned" on a drillpress (not a lathe) by wrapping tape around the forstner bit I used to drill the center hole. This enlarged the bit enough so that it would fit snugly in the hole it just created. The bit + cup were then put back into the chuck and the drillpress is now a lathe. This process was used only for final sanding and finishing, the rig would not have held the pressures necessary for shaping the cup. The outside is finished with danish oil and I used a lacquer on the inside to make it waterproof.</p>

<h4>Custom Wax Seal</h4>
<p>I have always wanted a wax seal, so I modeled one using Blender (free and open source) and had it 3d printed out of steel by Shapeways (New York company). I fashioned the handle from maple and walnut.</p>

<h4>Pen / Pencil Holder</h4>
<p>Walnut and Basswood. I struggled through this without a lathe.</p>

<h4>Children's Blocks</h4>
<p>Made for a friend of mine who is having a kid. Walnut and maple, finished with mineral oil. Absolutely no sharp edges or corners and all of the materials are food safe.</p>

<h4>Walnut and Basswood box</h4>
<p>I wanted to spice a classic box by laminating a strip of walnut into the center. In addition, I went with a hollowed out design as apposed to a six-face approach.</p>

<h4>Wooden Flags</h4>
<p>Christmas presents for my family. Scale models of flags made of basswood. Engravings were made with a laser cutter.</p>

<h4>Cutting Boards</h4>
<p>Most of my initial projects were cutting boards for my mom and her friends. Commonly featured woods are maple, walnut, cherry, and alder. I am a huge fan of mineral oil as a finish and it works great for cutting boards because it is food safe <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.878">[SOURCE]</a>. It looks especially good on dark woods like walnut. </p>

<h4>Screw Driver and Checker Plate</h4>
<p>This was made in my mechanical technology class. It was my first experience with a Bridgeport mill and metalworking in general. One set of holes is tapped. The screw driver started out as dowel stock and was forged using an induction furnace.</p>

<h4>Intro Whittling</h4>
<p>My first shot at whittling. I started out with a square .75" x .75" stock and was aiming to make a chess pawn. I couldn't get the centering correct, so it morphed into something else.</p>

<h4>Doorstop</h4>
<p>Made this out of scrap because my college did not provide one for our dorm. My first experience with Tung Oil and I like the coating it leaves behind.</p>
