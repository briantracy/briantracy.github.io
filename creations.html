        <h3>Creations</h3>
            <p>I enjoy making things out of wood (and other materials). The linked images are all jpegs and roughly 1.7MB each.</p>

        <h4>Walnut and Basswood box</h4>
            <p>I wanted to spice a classic box by laminating a strip of walnut into the center. In addition, I went with a hollowed out design as apposed to a six-face approach.</p>

        <h4>Screw Driver and Checker Plate</h4>
            <p>This was made in my mechanical technology class. It was my first experience with a Bridgeport mill and metalworking in general. One set of holes is tapped. The screw driver started out as dowel stock and was forged using an induction furnace.</p>

        <h4>Intro Whittling</h4>
            <p>My first shot at whittling. I started out with a square .75" x .75" stock and was aiming to make a chess pawn. I couldn't get the centering correct, so it morphed into something else.</p>

        <h4>Children's Blocks</h4>
            <p>Made for a friend of mine who is having a kid. Walnut and maple, finished with mineral oil. Absolutely no sharp edges or corners and I used foodsafe wood glue.</p>
