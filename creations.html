        <h3>Creations</h3>
            <p>I enjoy making things out of wood. Dollar bill is for scale.</p>

        <h4>Walnut and Basswood box</h4>
            <p>I wanted to spice of the classic box design by laminating a strip of walnut into the center. In addition, I went with a hollowed out design as apposed to a six-face approach.</p>

        <h4>Screw Driver and Checker Plate</h4>
            <p>This was made in my mechanical technology class. My first experience with a Bridgeport mill and forging metal.</p>

        <h4>Intro Whittling</h4>
            <p>My first shot at whittling. Not shaped after anything, but started as a square dowel.</p>

        <h4>Children's Blocks</h4>
            <p>Made for a friend of mine who is having a kid. Walnut and maple, finished with mineral oil. Absolutely no sharp edges or corners and I used foodsafe wood glue</p>
