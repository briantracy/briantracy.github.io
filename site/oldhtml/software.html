<h1>Software</h1>
<p>I like writing software that is easy to use and concise.</p>
<hr>

<h2>vigilant</h2>
<p>Command line tool for keeping track of how long you are using the computer each day. I could not find a native macOS solution for this problem, so I created my own script. vigilant is composed of two files: a <tt>launchd</tt> daemon script and a python program. Every 15 minutes, the daemon executes the python script, which in turn writes to a log that a certain amount of time has passed. The daemon does not execute while the computer is asleep, so when your computer is on, the script is counting. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/vigilant">[source]</a></p>

<h2>handy</h2>
<p>A command line tool that allows you to keep a reference list of commands that you either don't remember or don't want to type. In addition, you can reference each command by number to automatically insert it into your copy-paste buffer. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/handy">[source]</a></p>
   
<h2>workday</h2>
<p>A command line tool time card for tracking your hours. Written in (what should be) POSIX C so it should be as about as cross platform as it gets. Supports starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming your workday. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/workday">[source]</a></p>

<h2>DVDBounceSaver</h2>
<p>A screen saver for macOS that replicates the nostalgic "DVD logo bouncing around the screen" seen on so many CRT TVs about 15 years ago. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/DVDScreenSaver">[source]</a></p>

<h2>The Vike</h2>
<p>Developed iOS application to consolidate the scheduling information for my high school's sports teams. Included dates, times, opponents, and directions to each game for all sports teams. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/The-Vike">[source]</a></p>

<h2>Method to Madness</h2>
<p>Developed a tile based puzzle game (think 2048) for iOS. Puzzles are randomly generated for an infinite number of games. 1500+ downloads. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/Method-To-Madness">[source]</a></p>
