# About Me

Hello,

<img style="float:right;display:block;margin-top:-50px;margin-left:2em;" src="/images/about_image.png" width="200" height="200" alt="human+dog">

I am a computer programmer (at [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/)) who studied computer science at Brown University. My main areas of interest are computer systems and computer security.

I was born in Palo Alto, CA near the end of 1998, and I currently live there (I will soon be moving to Boston, MA).

I like playing guitar and woodworking. In college, I worked for my school as a systems administrator and a teaching assistant.

My email address is bri<span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override;direction:rtl;">iamg@<span style="font-size:0.01px;">obfuscation</span>33ycart.na</span>l.com

[Here is an album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/v551gaGyWBSHqJVo9) full of pictures of me.

I used to spend a bunch of time helping people on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2631920/brian-tracy), and that is where I learned how to program.

I also have a [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-tracy-129167a1
).

My public GPG key [is here](/resources/briantracy_gpg.txt)
