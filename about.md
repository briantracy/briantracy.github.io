# About Me

Hello,

<img style="float:right;display:block;margin-top:-50px;margin-left:2em;" src="/images/about_image.png" width="200" height="200" alt="human+dog">

I am a fourth year college student studying computer science at Brown University.
My main area of interest is computer systems and computer security.

I was born in Palo Alto, CA near the end of 1998, and I currently reside in Providence, RI.

Outside of school, I like playing guitar and woodworking. I also work for my
school as a systems administrator and a teaching assistant.

My email address is bri<span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override;direction:rtl;">iamg@33ycart.na</span>l.com
