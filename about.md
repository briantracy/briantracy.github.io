# About Me

Hello,

I am a third year college student studying computer science at Brown University.
My main area of interest is computer systems and computer security.

I am from Palo Alto, CA and currently reside in Providence, RI.

Outside of school, I like playing guitar and woodworking. I also work for my
school as a systems administrator in the computer lab and as a head teaching assistant for the software exploitation course.
