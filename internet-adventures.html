In an effort to convince myself that this time is not wasted, I like to have somthing to show for it. Roughly every week, I compile a list of the most interesting things I saw online and do a brief writeup. I try to keep these lists as academically diverse as possible in an attempt to not bore my friends who don&rsquo;t care about computer science, but are maybe more interested in things like the physical sciences, art, history, and politics.</p><p>The links included in each week&rsquo;s writeup are preserved via <a href="https://web.archive.org/">archive.org</a> to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>.</p><ol type="1"><li><a href="internet-adventures/linguistic-power.html">Linguistic Power</a></li></ol></main><footer>Last modified Dec 17 09:38:04 2019</footer></body></html>
