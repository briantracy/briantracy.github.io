In an effort to convince myself that this time is not wasted, I like to have somthing to show for it. Roughly every week, I compile a list of the most interesting things I saw online and do a brief writeup. I try to keep these lists as academically diverse as possible in an attempt to not bore my friends who don’t care about computer science, but are maybe more interested in things like the physical sciences, art, history, and politics.</p><p>The links included in each week’s writeup are preserved via <a href="https://web.archive.org/">archive.org</a> to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>.</p><ol type="1"><li><a href="internet-adventures/linguistic-power.html">Linguistic Power</a></li></ol></main><footer>Last modified Dec 16 22:15:35 2019</footer></body></html>
