In an effort to convince myself that this time is not wasted, I like to have something to show for it. Every few weeks, I compile a list of the most interesting things I saw online and do a brief writeup. I try to keep these lists as academically diverse as possible in an attempt to not bore my friends who don&rsquo;t care about computer science, but are maybe more interested in things like the physical sciences, art, history, and politics.</p><ol type="1"><li><a href="internet-adventures/linguistic-power.html">Linguistic Power</a></li></ol></main><footer>Last modified Mar 21 23:49:12 2020</footer></body></html>
