Note that I do not make the general assertion that film colors look better than digital colors, just that a <em>cheap</em> film camera out-competes a <em>cheap</em> digital. I have no doubt that high quality digital cameras are the best equipment for photography, it is just that I do not want to pay for a high quality digital camera because I do not take photography very seriously.</li><li>I can make my own prints (my brother and I got an enlarger for free on Craigslist) without having to use a digital printer.</li><li>I think the grain patterns in the film look cool, but I also think that adding them to a digital picture is really tacky.</li></ol><p>I shoot black and white for the following reasons (and no others):</p><ol type="1"><li>When I don't have any color film left.</li><li>I want to develop and print the pictures myself.</li><li>The colors of the subject are going to look "meh" (like an all green forest), and a black and white picture might look more interesting (sometimes colors distract from the contrast that is revealed when the image is B+W).</li></ol><p>I make these statements because I do not like the attitude that there are "intangibles" that make film/BW photography superior.</p></main><footer>Last modified Aug 2 23:13:17 2020</footer></body></html>
