<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>In my third semester at Brown, I took VISA 1510: Black and White Film Photography. During the semester I focused on man made scenes and produced a final portfolio of 16 images. Outside of school, I shoot color landscapes. The linked scans are all large files, so beware when opening.</p>

<p>For BW images taken during the semester, I used a Canon AE-1 with a 50mm lens and TRIX-400 film. My personal camera is a Canon A-1 loaded with a myriad of different color films (Fujicolor C200, Ektar 100, Kodak Gold 200, Portra 400)</p>
