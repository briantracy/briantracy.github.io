<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>In my third semester at Brown, I took VISA 1510: Black and White Film Photography. Here are some of my pictures from that course and beyond. Note: I have uploaded the high quality scans so to conserve bandwidth, you have to click on each individually instead of them auto-loading.</p>

<p>I used a Canon AE-1 loaded with Tri-X 400ISO. In addition, I took a few medium format (Texas Leica) and large format (Crown Graphic 4x5in) shots. We developed and enlarged all of the film by hand in the university dark room.</p>
