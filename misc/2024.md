# 2024

[2023](/misc/2023.html) was a another transitional year for me. I moved back to California half way through
the year and changed jobs in the process. I took a more disciplined approach to doing
the things I find healthy and felt proud of my effort. I want to continue my positive
momentum in 2024, but with more focus on fewer goals.


**New 2024 Goals**

* Athletic
  * Squat+Deadlift+Bench Press 1000lbs
  * Run 2 miles in 12 minutes
  * Olympic length triathlon
  * Plank 7 minutes

* Personal
  * Form closer friendships with coworkers
  * Continue to reduce procrastination
  * Become a better active listener
  * Be a student in some capacity

* Creative
  * Perform music for an audience
  * Complete 2 medium scale projects (software or other)
  * Write and share 2 short stories
