# Gardening

On June 26 2024, I planted 6 Bluebonnet flowers (Sundial Lupine) and a scattering of Orange Poppy flowers.

It was a complete failure and only 1 shoot surfaced. I think the issue was a lack of water. I will try again soon.

On January 8 2025, I tried again with an entire packet of assorted wildflowers. [Here is a picture of the first watering](/images/garden_planted_alma.png)
