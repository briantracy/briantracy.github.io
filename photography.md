# Photography

I use a Canon A1 camera loaded with an assortment of Kodak Gold 200, Kodak Ultramax 400, Fuji C200, Ektar 100.

I took a black and white film photography course offered by the art department at my school as my introduction to photography.

I mostly take pictures of man made things alongside nature.

The scans I receive are very large, so instead of hosting them here and clogging up my local disk, I will [let Google Photos do the heavy lifting!](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WcSDfHjpmXd2sts1A)
