<h3>The Bloated Internet</h3>
<p><a href="images/nytimes.jpg">[Exhibit 1]</a> New York Times homepage. A few observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roughly 150 requests for first page load. 1.5 requests per second from then on</li>
<li>7.6 MB of data transferred. There are at MOST 1000 words (1kb ASCII encoded) on the homepage.</li>
<li>4.63 seconds to load the page.</li>
<li>First quarter of page is taken up by advertisement.</li>
</ol>
After 1 minute of being on the homepage, we are at 15MB data transferred and 400 requests made. When visiting the site with uBlock Origin + EFF Privacy Badger extensions, 1.1MB of data is transferred with only 62 requests. (14:1 crap to content ratio)
<p><a href="images/berkshire.jpg">[Exhibit 2]</a> Berkshire Hathaway Inc. homepage. A few observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>2 requests made (1 html page, 1 .gif, 0 stylesheets, 0 scripts). 0 requests per second from then on.</li>
<li>6.2 KB of data transferred. 5K is text, the other 1K is the .gif</li>
<li>270 milliseconds to load the page.</li>
<li>0% advertisements.</li>
</ol>
Super clean and informative layout.
<hr>
<p>I understand that these two companies serve different purposes and are aimed at different people. However, the first page is very indicative of the current state of the commercial web. This site aims to be firmly in the Exhibit 2 category. This is <u>static content</u>. There is no need for scripts, styles, or inline images (one exception is homepage).</p>
