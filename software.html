<h3>Software</h3>

<h4><u>handy</u></h4>
<p>A command line tool that allows you to keep a reference list of commands that you either don't remember or don't want to type. In addition, you can reference each command by number to automatically insert it into your copy-paste buffer. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/handy">[source]</a></p>
   
<h4><u>workday</u></h4>
<p>A command line tool time card for tracking your hours. Written in (what should be) POSIX C so it should be as about as cross platform as it gets. Supports starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming your workday. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/workday">[source]</a></p>

<h4><u>DVDBounceSaver</u></h4>
<p>A screen saver for macOS that replicates the nostalgic "DVD logo bouncing around the screen" seen on so many CRT TVs about 15 years ago. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/DVDScreenSaver">[source]</a></p>

<h4><u>The Vike</u></h4>
<p>Developed iOS application to consolidate the scheduling information for my high school's sports teams. Included dates, times, opponents, and directions to each game for all sports teams. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/The-Vike">[source]</a></p>

<h4><u>Method to Madness</u></h4>
<p>Developed a tile based puzzle game (think 2048) for iOS. Puzzles are randomly generated for an infinite number of games. 1500+ downloads. <a href="https://github.com/briantracy/Method-To-Madness">[source]</a></p>
