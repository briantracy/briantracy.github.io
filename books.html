<h1>Books</h1>
  <p>I like discussing books with people, but I always seem to forget the ones I have read. 
  This list is in rough reverse chronological order</p>

<tr><th>Title</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Fifth Season*, The Obelisk Gate, The Stone Sky</td>
    <td>A+ world building from the author. I really love how most of the history of the world is a mystery until around the last half of the third book. This book is not afraid to get gritty and realistic, and I think it approaches subjects like death, legacy, sex, and morality in very mature ways.</td>
<tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Sparrow&#8224; (Mary Doria Russell)</td>
    <td></td>
<tr>
    <td>Foundation (Asimov)</td>
    <td>Amazingly gripping story, I am excited to read the rest of the series.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Hyperion **, Fall of Hyperion</td>
    <td>After reading Dune, I explicitly searched for "sci-fi like dune" and was recommended Hyperion. It is absolutely on the same level as Dune and the storytelling and mystery is great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Dune Series ***</td>
    <td>I love the scope of these novels. From Butlerian Jihad -- Reign of House Corrino (10,000 years) -- Life of Muad'dib -- Reign of Leto 2 (3,500 years) -- Scattering (1,500 years) -- Events of Heretics and Chapterhouse, more time is covered that any other book series I have read. I see the series being broken into three parts: The early game (first 3 books), the transition (book 4 - God Emperor), the endgame (books 5,6). Each part had a new set of characters, but had so many references back the the previous books that they all felt connected. This is my favorite book series by far, and I am so excited for the movie in 2020.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>East of Eden **</td>
    <td>This book had a historical fiction vibe to it that I really liked. Normally, I am not a fan of being beaten over the head with allegory, but I thought that the way the story of Cain and Abel was woven through the entire book was really great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Long Walk *</td>
    <td>First Steven King book I read. This book does a great job of inducing anxiety and making the plight of the characters real.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Declaration of Independence + US Constitution</td>
    <td>Big fan of the Bill of Rights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</td>
    <td>Not as good as the other two KingKiller books. I am patiently waiting for the third one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Mistborn Series *</td>
    <td>My first fantasy series, I really love the convincing worldbuilding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Shop Class as Soulcraft</td>
    <td>(Abandoned) Thought the author was a tool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Old Man and the Sea</td>
    <td>I have not read any other books by Hemingway, but I am surprised to see that people consider this his best. I did not think it was that groundbreaking. I might be missing some historical context that would boost this book's meaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>A Little Life *</td>
    <td>The only book that I have read that tackles mental health issues in a way that seems genuine. The author, a female, does a great job writing a virtually all male cast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Death of Ivan Ilych</td>
    <td>This is one of those books that I read because I saw it so frequently in book lists. I might have to read it again when I get older to fully appreciate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Catcher in the Rye</td>
    <td>Not a fan of Holden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Tsar of Love and Techno</td>
    <td>Required reading for my college. I like how each story connected to the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Kite Runner</td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Communist Manifesto</td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>1984</td>
    <td>I liked this story, but didn't always understand the motivation behind the governments action. Why would they go through all of the trouble of torturing and brainwashing ``problematic people'' when they could just kill them (which they do plenty of).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Name of the Wind, The Wise Man's Fear *</td>
    <td>Insane world building. So excited for the third book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Art of War</td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Hobbit</td>
    <td>The last 20 pages of this book spawned a 2.5 hour movie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Martian</td>
    <td>Reminded me of Hatchet, but in space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Night (Wiesel)</td>
    <td>Haunting book. I'm glad this was required reading for school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa</td>
    <td>This is one of the books that inspired the HBO series 'The Pacific'. My grandfather tells me that our family is related to the author, Eugene Sledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Ender's Game *</td>
    <td>Classic sci-fi. Really great world building and a twist that blew my mind. One of the few books I have read that 1. deals with kids, and 2. accurately portrays the maturity of children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Whale Talk</td>
    <td>Picked this one up randomly and I was blown away by how good it was. Very emotional story that does a great job showing how kids can take part in real life, adult situations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>All Quiet on the Western Front</td>
    <td>WW1 is often overshadowed by WW2 in popular culture, and I think that's a shame. With director Peter Jackson's ``They Shall Never Grow Old'', WW1 has been given a revival in the movie industry and I hope that opens the door for another film adaptation of this book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>World War Z</td>
    <td>I wish the movie had been more true to this book, because it was awesome. Interesting note: the author is Mel Brook's son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Book Thief</td>
    <td>Very emotional book with a interesting narration style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Of Mice and Men</td>
    <td>Lots of pop culture references to this book (Key and Peele sketch, New Girl (tv show) makes a joke about a character giving an ``Of Mice and Men'' vibe towards a puppy, ...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Great Gatsby</td>
    <td>I thought the movie (2013) did a good job adapting this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Fahrenheit 451</td>
    <td>I really liked this one because of how well it predicted the future (for example, the wife is always wearing headphones).</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>-- Order gets muddy here, pre high school --</td><td></td></tr>

<tr>
    <td>Hunger Games Series</td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Pendragon Series</td>
    <td>I started reading the first one, then stopped because I was not that into it. Then the author, DJ MacHale came to my middle school. He was such a cool guy, I had to give the books another shot. The scope of this series is huge (10 books) and it definitely does a good job utilizing that much space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Hatchet</td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Giver</td><td>Movie was good too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Supernaturalist</td>
    <td>Same author as Artemis Fowl. Just as good, I wish there was a sequel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Code Talker</td>
    <td>First book about war that I read. It is very good for a young adult book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The Darkest Minds</td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Artemis Fowl Series *</td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Inheritance Cycle (Eragon, ...) *</td>
    <td>Best books of my childhood.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
    <td>My Side of the Mountain, Other Side of the Mountain</td>
    <td>Very similar to Hatchet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Tales of the Greek Heroes</td>
    <td>I read this after Percy Jackson got me interested in Greek mythology.</td>

    <td>Tom Sawyer</td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Percy Jackson Series</td><td>First book I was excited to read. I have a very fond memory of reading the last book in this series during class in 5th grade, only to be interrupted by my teacher asking me for an answer. I gave a completely garbage response and was asked to hand over the book.</td></tr>
