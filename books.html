Below is a list of all the books I can remember reading with the most recent appearing first. &dagger; = in progress, * = favorite</p><p>I mostly read well known books, so the author is omitted if it is obvious. Keep in mind that the comments might contain spoilers.</p><hr><table><colgroup><col style="width: 41%"><col style="width: 58%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Title</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>The Great Alone</td><td>This is a very short book, and I am glad for that. The plot was very predictable, and yet, the characters didn&rsquo;t act like how I have perceived real people to act. It was like that classic TV show situation where people don&rsquo;t actually verbalize what they are feeling, and then act surprised when others act in ways they don&rsquo;t appreciate. However, despite this, I stayed up late several nights in a row reading this book. This book has a sort of realism (I&rsquo;m defining this as &ldquo;feels like it could be possible&rdquo;) that is fascinating.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Altered Carbon</td><td>Really cool scifi worldbuilding and excellent pacing. I watched the show on Netflix about a year ago and liked it, so I thought I would read the book. I am glad I did.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Brave New World</td><td>I recently read an <a href="/resources/keynes_future.pdf">an essay by Keynes</a> about the future of economics once mass automation has ended the need for everyone to work. Brave New World seems to be a pessimistic prediction of the world Keynes imagined, and I think that it is really well conceived. My favorite character is Mustapha Mond.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Jane Eyre *</td><td>Absolutely loved it. My reading list is very dude heavy, so it was nice to get a female perspective, both from a main character and author. I never doubted Mr.&nbsp;Rochester for a second, I love that guy.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Gentlemen Bankers: The World of J.P. Morgan</td><td>Assigned reading in my History of Capitalism course. While it is interesting to see how magnates come to power, I think it is more interesting how they retain that power and transform it into a dynasty for their children. This book reminds me a lot of HBO&rsquo;s <em>Succession</em>, about a media magnate and his family.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Fifth Season*, The Obelisk Gate, The Stone Sky</td><td>Fantastic world building and storytelling. The narrative structure of the first book is quite novel. It follows three separate characters that are later revealed to be the same woman at different points in her life. If you are like me and love learning about the lore behind the fantasy, stick with all three books as the reveals come very late in the series.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Attack on Titan *</td><td>First comic book I have ever read. Probably my favorite fictional world. The fact that the author has been releasing a chapter every month for 10 years is amazing. The art is insane, the plot is unique, the themes are real; I would recommend AOT to anyone. As of January 2020, the author made an announcement that he would be finishing the series within the year!</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)</td><td>I picked this book up after seeing it beat out Hyperion on a sci-fi list. This is the only book I have read that is built mostly on religious themes and internal conflicts of faith.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Foundation (Asimov)</td><td>I love books about large scale journeys through time (see Dune), and this one does a great job of covering a plot whose scope reaches across the centuries.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Hyperion *, Fall of Hyperion</td><td>God Tier Science Fiction. This book and its sequel are a must read for fans of the genre. On the sequel: the author admits that he needed a down payment on the mortgage for his house, so he split the book into two parts so he could make more money off the story. Respect.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Dune Series *</td><td>One of my favorites &ndash; All six books are epic, but the fourth, God Emperor of Dune is the highlight of the series. I am so hyped for the movie coming out in 2020</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>East of Eden *</td><td>This one is a tear jerker that really made me think about what it means to live an entire lifetime. As a young person, the American life expectancy of 77 years seems like an impossibly long time. It was nice to see how the characters evolved over the course of the book</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Long Walk *</td><td>This book does a great job of instilling the reader with the sense of anxiety that the characters are feeling.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Declaration of Independence + US Constitution</td><td>From a political perspective, I am a staunch constitutionalist. Reading this text is so exciting and inspiring, although parsing the grammar of the language that was used at the time is very difficult. Reading alongside an interpreted version is also very helpful; knowing what to look for makes the run on sentences more manageable.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</td><td>I did not like this one as much as the two KingKiller books, but it served as a good read during the unbearable hiatus that we are currently experiencing before the final book in the series.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Mistborn Series *</td><td>I really love how well these books are structured, both in terms of pacing and worldbuilding. The magic is so internally consistent and it provides a refreshing, almost &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; power.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><del>Shop Class as Soulcraft</del></td><td>Stopped reading this one because I didn&rsquo;t like the attitude of author towards the current generation&rsquo;s work ethic. He seemed to romanticize the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo;, which has some merit, but he didn&rsquo;t really provide a lot of evidence for his claims that young people&rsquo;s lives needed a different kind of work. I will reread and hopefully make a more concrete assessment.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Old Man and the Sea</td><td>I think I missed the point of this book entirely, so maybe I will reread and do some more thinking.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>A Little Life *</td><td>This is an amazing book for many reasons. First, the book follows the four main characters for their entire lives. Second, it provides insights into both living with a mental illness and supporting friends with mental illnesses that I thought were very poignant.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Death of Ivan Ilych</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Catcher in the Rye</td><td>Holden is my least favorite character in any book. He acts like he is smarter than everyone and has no self awareness.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Tsar of Love and Techno</td><td>Required reading for my first summer before college. I liked the stories spanned several decades and all joined together at the end.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Kite Runner</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Communist Manifesto</td><td>I read this because I became interested in the Cold War and what exactly all the hype was about. Growing up in America, it is easy for me to think that Economics == Capitalism, and that our current system is the best system. This book didn&rsquo;t challenge that belief, but it made me think more about it.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>1984</td><td>As a staunch supporter of civil liberties and restricted government power, this book is a classic!</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Name of the Wind, The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear *</td><td>Pat Rothfuss really needs to release the third book! The magic system in this series is unique amongst the fantasy I have read because it has its basis in chemistry and physics. Reminds me of the magic in Mistborn.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Art of War</td><td>Not very applicable to my life as a student!</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Puritan Dilemma</td><td>One of the most boring books I&rsquo;ve read.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Hobbit</td><td>The last 40 pages of this book spawned a 3 hour movie.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Martian</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Night (Wiesel)</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Ender&rsquo;s Game *</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Whale Talk</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>All Quiet on the Western Front</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>World War Z</td><td>Very different from the movie, so if you were disappointed with that, check out the book. It&rsquo;s structured as a series of short stories from survivors of the war.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Book Thief</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Of Mice and Men</td><td>This was assigned reading in 9th grade. Rumor has it, the instant the book was announced, someone in another class stood up and said &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the one where George kills Lenny at the end?&rdquo;</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Great Gatsby</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Fahrenheit 451</td><td>HBO adaptation was bad. My favorite part of the book was the main character&rsquo;s wife Mildred. She is shown to be addicted to listening to broadcasts that are beamed directly into little &ldquo;seashells&rdquo; in her ears. This is such an accurate depiction of what we now do with wireless headphones, it makes me think of the novel every time I see a crowd of people all listening to something or on their phones. The HBO adaptation cut her character entirely, which was disappointing because her death at the hands of a rival nation during the one day war was the climax of the book.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Hunger Games Series</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Knife of Never Letting Go</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>To Kill a Mockingbird</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Pendragon Series</td><td>I started reading this book and then gave it up. A few months later, the author, DJ MacHale came and spoke to my middle school. He was a really great guy, so I gave the book a second shot. I ended up reading all 10 consecutively.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Hatchet</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Giver</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Supernaturalist</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Code Talker</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Darkest Minds</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Harry Potter (1,5,6,7)</td><td>I have a lot to say about HP. My biggest complaint is that the worldbuilding is just plain bad (illogical and inconsistent). For example, it is impossible that the Weasleys are poor (magic can be trivially monetized, ie: duplicating currency), it is impossible that not a single wizard has defected and told the muggle world about the existence of wizards, it is ridiculous that the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix were in a state of &ldquo;war&rdquo;, yet no muggle weapons are even considered. In many ways, my complaints boil down to the fact that the author had to make the series &ldquo;PG&rdquo; rated. The explanation for most of these issues is that &ldquo;Wizards don&rsquo;t concern themselves with the muggle world&rdquo;, or some sort of false sense of superiority preventing wizards from adopting muggle technology. This is pretty weak&mldr; Having a moral superiority over something doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t respect it or learn from it. Also, the tone is pretty inconsistent with respect to the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo;. They should have been way more ruthless and intelligent. Voldemort makes all of his horcruxes famous objects because he&rsquo;s vain? Come on. It really feels like the author wanted to make a point about genocide being bad, yet didn&rsquo;t want to actually to make an intelligent critique and instead set up this strawman of a villain that was kind of half assing &ldquo;being bad&rdquo;. I really love digging through the lore of created worlds, and when they don&rsquo;t hold up to even basic inspection, it makes me angry!</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Artemis Fowl Series *</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Inheritance Cycle (Eragon, &mldr;) *</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Compound</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The City of Ember</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Green Glass Sea</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Frindle</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Seabiscuit</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Holes</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>My Side of the Mountain, Other Side of the Mountain</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Tales of the Greek Heroes</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Gloomy Gus</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Thief Lord *</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Leviathan (Scott Westerfield)</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Haunting of Freddy</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Alex Rider Series (Stormbreaker, &mldr;)</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>A Brief History of Time</td><td>Relax, it was the illustrated version.
