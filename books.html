<h3>Books</h3>
<p>I like discussing books with people, but I always seem to forget the ones I have read. This list is in rough reverse chronological order</p>
&#8224;<i> = in progress</i>, * <i>= favorite</i>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Title</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
<tr><td>Foundation (Asimov) &#8224;</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Hyperion **, Fall of Hyperion</td><td>After reading Dune, I explicitly searched for "sci-fi like dune" and was recommended Hyperion. It is absolutely on the same level as Dune and the storytelling and mystery is great.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dune *, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune,<br> God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune (all amazing)</td><td>I love the scope of these novels. From Butlerian Jihad -- Reign of House Corrino (10,000 years) -- Life of Muad'dib -- Reign of Leto 2 (3,500 years) -- Scattering (1,500 years) -- Events of Heretics and Chapterhouse, more time is covered that any other book series I have read. My favorite character has to be Leto 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>East of Eden **</td><td>I am not sure why I liked this one, but I did.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Long Walk *</td><td>First Steven King book I read. Reading this book made me feel like I was one of the contestants in the walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Declaration of Independence + US Constitution</td><td>Big fan of the Bill of Rights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</td><td>Not as good as the other two KingKiller books. I am patiently waiting for the third one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mistborn Series *</td><td>My first fantasy series, I really love the convincing worldbuilding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shop Class as Soulcraft</td><td>(Abandoned) Thought the author was a tool.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Old Man and the Sea</td><td>I have not read any other books by Hemingway, but I am surprised to see that people consider this his best. I did not think it was that groundbreaking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A Little Life *</td><td>The only book that I have read that tackles mental health issues in a way that seems genuine. I also really like the virtually all male cast and how I could imagine myself as each character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Death of Ivan Ilych</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Catcher in the Rye</td><td>Not a fan of Holden.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Tsar of Love and Techno</td><td>Required reading for my college. I like how each story connected to the others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Kite Runner</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Communist Manifesto</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>1984</td><td>I liked this one alot,  but didn't always understand the motivation behind the governments action. Why would they go through all of the trouble of torturing and brainwashing people when they could just kill them (which they do alot).</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Name of the Wind, The Wise Man's Fear *</td><td>Insane worldbuilding. So excited for the third book.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Art of War</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Hobbit</td><td>The last 20 pages of this book spawned a 2.5 hour movie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Martian</td><td>Reminded me of Hatchet, but in space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa</td><td>This is one of the books that inspired the HBO series 'The Pacific'. My grandfather tells me that our family is related to the author, Eugene Sledge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ender's Game *</td><td>Classic sci-fi. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Whale Talk</td><td>Picked this one up randomly and I was blown away by how good it was. Very emotional story that does a great job showing how kids can ntake part in real life, adult situations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>All Quiet on the Western Front</td><td>WW1 is often overshadowed by WW2 in popular culture, and I think that's a shame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>World War Z</td><td>I wish the movie had been more true to this book, because it was awesome. Interesting note: the author is Mel Brook's son.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Book Thief</td><td>Solid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Of Mice and Men</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Great Gatsby</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Fahrenheit 451</td><td>I really liked this one because of how well it predicted the future (for example, the wife is always wearing headphones).</td></tr>
<tr><td>-- Order gets muddy here, pre high school --</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Hunger Games Series</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Pendragon Series</td><td>I started reading the first one, then stopped because I was not that into it. Then the author, DJ MacHale came to my middle school. He was such a cool guy, I had to give the books another shot. The scope of this series is huge (10 books) and it definitely does a good job utilizing that much space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hatchet</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Giver</td><td>Movie was aight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Supernaturalist</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Code Talker</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Darkest Minds</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Artemis Fowl Series *</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Inheritance Cycle (Eragon, ...) *</td><td>Best books of my childhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Compound</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The City of Ember</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Green Glass Sea</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Frindle</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Seabiscuit</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Holes</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>My Side of the Mountain, Other Side of the Mountain</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tales of the Greek Heroes</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Gloomy Gus</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Thief Lord *</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Haunting of Freddy</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Alex Rider Series (Stormbreaker, ...)</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>A Brief History of Time</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tom Sawyer</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Percy Jackson Series</td><td>First book I was excited to read. I have a very fond memory of reading the last book in this series during class in 5th grade, only to be interrupted by my teacher asking me for an answer. I gave a completely garbage response and was asked to hand over the book.</td></tr>
