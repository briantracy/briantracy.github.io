Below is a list of all the books I can remember reading with the most recent appearing first. &dagger; = in progress, * = favorite</p><p>I mostly read well known books, so the author is omitted if it is obvious. Keep in mind that the comments might contain spoilers.</p><table><colgroup><col style="width: 41%"><col style="width: 58%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Title</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Brave New World</td><td>I recently read an <a href="/resources/keynes_future.pdf">an essay by Keynes</a> about the future of economics once mass automation has ended the need for everyone to work. Brave New World seems to be a pessimistic prediction of the world Keynes imagined, and I think that it is really well conceived. My favorite character is Mustapha Mond.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Jane Eyre *</td><td>Absolutely loved it. My reading list is very dude heavy, so it was nice to get a female perspective, both from a main character and author. I never doubted Mr.&nbsp;Rochester for a second, I love that guy.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Gentlemen Bankers: The World of J.P. Morgan</td><td>Assigned reading in my History of Capitalism course. While it is interesting to see how magnates come to power, I think it is more interesting how they retain that power and transform it into a dynasty for their children. This book reminds me a lot of HBO&rsquo;s <em>Succession</em>, about a media magnate and his family.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Fifth Season*, The Obelisk Gate, The Stone Sky</td><td>Fantastic world building and storytelling. The narrative structure of the first book is quite novel. It follows three separate characters that are later revealed to be the same woman at different points in her life. If you are like me and love learning about the lore behind the fantasy, stick with all three books as the reveals come very late in the series.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Attack on Titan *</td><td>First comic book I have ever read. Probably my favorite fictional world. The fact that the author has been releasing a chapter every month for 10 years is amazing. The art is insane, the plot is unique, the themes are real; I would recommend AOT to anyone.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)</td><td>I picked this book up after seeing it beat out Hyperion on a sci-fi list. This is the only book I have read that is built mostly on religious themes and internal conflicts of faith.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Foundation (Asimov)</td><td>I love books about large scale journeys through time (see Dune), and this one does a great job of covering a plot whose scope reaches across the centuries.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Hyperion *, Fall of Hyperion</td><td>God Tier Science Fiction. This book and its sequel are a must read for fans of the genre. On the sequel: the author admits that he needed a down payment on the mortgage for his house, so he split the book into two parts so he could make more money off the story. Respect.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Dune Series *</td><td>One of my favorites &ndash; All six books are epic, but the fourth, God Emperor of Dune is the highlight of the series. I am so hyped for the movie coming out in 2020</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>East of Eden *</td><td>This one is a tear jerker that really made me think about what it means to live an entire lifetime. As a young person, the American life expectancy of 77 years seems like an impossibly long time. It was nice to see how the characters evolved over the course of the book</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Long Walk *</td><td>This book does a great job of instilling the reader with the sense of anxiety that the characters are feeling.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Declaration of Independence + US Constitution</td><td>From a political perspective, I am a staunch constitutionalist. Reading this text is so exciting and inspiring, although parsing the grammar of the language that was used at the time is very difficult. Reading alongside an interpreted version is also very helpful; knowing what to look for makes the run on sentences more manageable.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</td><td>I did not like this one as much as the two KingKiller books, but it served as a good read during the unbearable hiatus that we are currently experiencing before the final book in the series.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Mistborn Series *</td><td>I really love how well these books are structured, both in terms of pacing and worldbuilding. The magic is so internally consistent and it provides a refreshing, almost &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; power.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><del>Shop Class as Soulcraft</del></td><td>Stopped reading this one because I didn&rsquo;t like the attitude of author towards the current generation&rsquo;s work ethic. He seemed to romanticize the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo;, which has some merit, but he didn&rsquo;t really provide a lot of evidence for his claims that young people&rsquo;s lives needed a different kind of work. I will reread and hopefully make a more concrete assessment.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Old Man and the Sea</td><td>I think I missed the point of this book entirely, so maybe I will reread and do some more thinking.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>A Little Life *</td><td>This is an amazing book for many reasons. First, the book follows the four main characters for their entire lives. Second, it provides insights into both living with a mental illness and supporting friends with mental illnesses that I thought were very poignant.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Death of Ivan Ilych</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Catcher in the Rye</td><td>Holden is my least favorite character in any book. He acts like he is smarter than everyone and has no self awareness.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Tsar of Love and Techno</td><td>Required reading for my first summer before college. I liked the stories spanned several decades and all joined together at the end.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Kite Runner</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Communist Manifesto</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>1984</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Name of the Wind, The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear *</td><td>Pat Rothfuss really needs to release the third book!</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Art of War</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Puritan Dilemma</td><td>One of the most boring books I&rsquo;ve read.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Hobbit</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Martian</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Night (Wiesel)</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Ender&rsquo;s Game *</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Whale Talk</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>All Quiet on the Western Front</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>World War Z</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Book Thief</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Of Mice and Men</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Great Gatsby</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Fahrenheit 451</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Hunger Games Series</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>To Kill a Mockingbird</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Pendragon Series</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Hatchet</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Giver</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Supernaturalist</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Code Talker</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Darkest Minds</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Artemis Fowl Series *</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Inheritance Cycle (Eragon, &mldr;) *</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Compound</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The City of Ember</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>The Green Glass Sea</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Frindle</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Seabiscuit</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Holes</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>My Side of the Mountain, Other Side of the Mountain</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Tales of the Greek Heroes</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Gloomy Gus</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Thief Lord *</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Leviathan (Scott Westerfield)</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>The Haunting of Freddy</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Alex Rider Series (Stormbreaker, &mldr;)</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>A Brief History of Time</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Half Moon Investigations</td><td></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Tom Sawyer</td><td></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Percy Jackson Series</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></main><footer>Last modified Dec 21 21:59:00 2019</footer></body></html>
