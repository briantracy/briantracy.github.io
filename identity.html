The problem with this approach is that anyone could have bought this domain and made that statement.</p><p>Attempt two would be to record a video of me saying "I am Brian Tracy and I own briantracy.xyz". This is better, but there is no way to verify that the person you see speaking is actually me. A <strong>trusted third party</strong> needs to verify that the person with my face is Brian Tracy, and then in turn, that Brian Tracy owns briantracy.xyz</p><p>For some definitions of "trusted", the most trusted third party possible would be the US Government. Conveniently, the government issues a bidirectional mapping from face to legal name in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_identification">Photo IDs</a>.</p><p>So by presenting a photo id issued by a trusted government, we build a chain of trust from the government to my domain. Once we have this, anything hosted on my domain could be considered legitimately from me.</p><p>With the sophistication of modern image manipulation software, a picture with my face, a photo id, and then the text "I own briantracy.xyz" is not enough. Fortunately, we do not yet have the technology (available to everybody) to doctor videos as convincingly.</p><p>So I offer the following: a video with my face, several forms of photo id issued by the US Government, and a claim of ownership of briantracy.xyz</p></main><footer>Last modified Nov 29 16:34:36 2020</footer></body></html>
