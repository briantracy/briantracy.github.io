A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:</p><p>Here is some <code>monospaced text for you</code></p><p>Break Incoming</p><hr><p>That was the break</p><h2>Heading Level 2</h2><p>Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.</p><ol type="1"><li><p>--My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a</p></li><li><p>Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.</p></li><li><p>We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out</p></li><li><p>twenty quid?</p></li></ol><h3>Heading Level 3</h3><p>He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.</p><ul><li><p>--A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?</p></li><li><p>--I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark</p></li><li><p>with a man I I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a</p></li><li><p>black panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If</p></li><li><p>he stays on here I am off.</p></li></ul><h4>Heading Level 4</h4><p>He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.</p><h5>Heading Level 5</h5><p>He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.</p><pre><code>static void calculate_refcounts(int *counts, vnode_t *vnode) {
