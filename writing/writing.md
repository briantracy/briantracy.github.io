1. I wrote a [paper on the politics of cryptography](/resources/crypto_paper.pdf) for a course my Junior year. It explores
government regulation and legal precedent around the use of strong encryption for communications, as well as an overview of
some of the technical aspects involved.

2. [Here is a walkthrough](nas.html) of how I set up a file server on my local network to store backups from my computer.

3. [bthreads](bthreads.html) is the Brian/Bad Threading library. It is a toy
 Linux threading library that implements mutexes using atomic x86 instructions.
