### Papers

1. I wrote a [paper on the politics of cryptography](/resources/crypto_paper.pdf) for a course my Junior year. It explores
government regulation and legal precedent around the use of strong encryption for communications, as well as an overview of
some of the technical aspects involved.

2. I wrote a paper about [syscall filtering](/resources/syscall_paper.pdf) for a software exploitation course.


### Systems Programming Series

In this series, I re-implement classic systems programming concepts. It is an educational series aimed towards people who want to learn more about the core concepts behind their favorite programs.

1. [bthreads](bthreads.html) is the Brian/Bad Threading library. It is a toy
 Linux threading library that implements mutexes using atomic x86 instructions.

2. [btar](btar.html) is a clone(ish) of tar, with support for random access to files in the archive.

3. [bperf](bperf.html) is a profiler for C programs.


### Technical Shorts

1. A short opinion about the dangers of using [a new JavaScript language feature](object-literals.html).

2. [Don't Copy Paste Into a Shell](copy-paste-shell.html). A message of warning and a proof of why you should never copy text from a website and paste it into your terminal.

3. My first [open source contribution](pip-open-source.html)!

### Other

1. [No Internet Week](no-internet-week.html)

2. [Density of Coins](currency-density.html)
