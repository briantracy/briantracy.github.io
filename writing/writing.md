1. I wrote a [paper on the politics of cryptography](/resources/crypto_paper.pdf) for a course my Junior year. It explores
government regulation and legal precedent around the use of strong encryption for communications, as well as an overview of
some of the technical aspects involved.

2. [bthreads](bthreads.html) is the Brian/Bad Threading library. It is a toy
 Linux threading library that implements mutexes using atomic x86 instructions.

3. A short opinion about the dangers of using [a new JavaScript language feature](object-literals.html).
