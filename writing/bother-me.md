# Things that bother me

1. The incorrect use of the following words
    * literally
    * exponentially

2. The use of the following phrases
    * scientifically proven
    * can't prove a negative
    * apples to oranges

3. Various iOS "features"
    * Can't turn the volume all the way down while on a call
    * Can't turn the flashlight on while taking a picture (but you can while taking a video)

4. The lack of any real `const` correctness in Java. The `final` keyword is under powered.
