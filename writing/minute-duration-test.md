# Do I Know How Long a Minute Is?

How accurate is my intuition for the duration of a minute? I am not sure, so I ran an experiment to find out.

For each data point, I would start a stopwatch, wait for what I thought was a minute, then stop the clock and record the results. I did not want my knowledge of the result to allow me to tune my perception, so I wrote a program that recorded my results without ever showing them to me (code included at end).

For the first batch of tests, I counted the minute in my head and got the following times (in milliseconds): `60251, 55950, 54061, 53716, 54807, 50151, 50322, 49383, 49992, 46967`.


For the second batch of tests, I did not count the time and instead went purely on feel.
