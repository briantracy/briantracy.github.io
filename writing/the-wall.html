Here I will write about why I like it so much, my experience listening to it, and some basic information about the album.</p><p><strong>Album Data:</strong> "The Wall" was released in 1979, contains 26 songs, and has a length of 80 minutes. It is often logically split into two halves, and takes 2x12in LP records (4 sides in total) to store.</p><p><strong>Story:</strong></p><p><strong>Seamless Listening:</strong></p><p><strong>Interludes:</strong></p><p><strong>Orchestral Elements:</strong></p><p><strong>Lack of Repetitive Songs:</strong> Of the 26 songs only 6 of them have a chorus section ("Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2", "Mother", "Young Lust", "Hey You", "Comfortably Numb", "The Trial"). This is really a testament to the strong lyricism and wealth of story that these songs have to work with.</p><p><strong>Inter-song Motifs:</strong></p><p><strong>Tie-in Movie:</strong></p></main><footer>Last modified Jul 14 22:24:36 2022</footer></body></html>
