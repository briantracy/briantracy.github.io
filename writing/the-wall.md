# My Favorite Album

My favorite album is "The Wall" by Pink Floyd. Here I will write about why I like it so much, my experience listening to it, and some basic information about the album.



**Album Data:** "The Wall" was released in 1979, contains 26 songs, and has a length of 80 minutes. It is often logically split into two halves, and takes 2x12in LP records (4 sides in total) to store.


**Story:**
 
**Seamless Listening:**

**Interludes:**

**Orchestral Elements:**

**Lack of Repetitive Songs:** Of the 26 songs only 6 of them have a chorus section ("Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2", "Mother", "Young Lust", "Hey You", "Comfortably Numb", "The Trial"). This is really a testament to the strong lyricism and wealth of story that these songs have to work with.
