The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.</em></p><p>I read this and thought, "wow that seems like an oversight", and then, with the hubris of a recent college graduate, I thought "I can do better".</p><h3>Tar Overview</h3><p><code>tar</code> converts a set of files into a single file. This new file, known as an "archive" (hence the name <strong>t</strong>ape <strong>ar</strong>chive, tape being the magnetic storage medium) can later be converted back into the original set of files.</p><p>One of the great things about files is that they are just bytes, so to amalgamate a set of files, all you really have to do is concatenate their contents. Add in some metadata about which file starts where, and this is pretty much it.</p><h3>Design Overview</h3><p>Random access was the one feature I wanted to add, so I had this in mind when beginning the design process. To get random access to a given file in the archive, I would have to know where all the files are without reading the entire archive.</p><p>We can model this information with a method that is extremely similar to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extent_(file_systems)">Extents</a> in file systems. Essentially, each file is identified in the archive by a tuple of <code>(offset, length)</code>, and all of these tuples are stored at the head of the archive.</p><p>All you need now is a way to associate a file name with a single tuple, and the archive is complete.</p><h3>File Names</h3><p>Most of the <code>tar</code> implementations I have read about have all had fixed length requirements for file names. The benefit to having a maximum file length is that it simplifies the layout of metadata. The downside is that you now have an upper bound on the name of a file, which is normally much smaller than the real upper bound provided by the OS. In addition, fixed length file name fields lead to wasted space when the majority of your files have short names.</p><p><code>btar</code> stores file names separately from extent metadata. Much like how a compiler will separate code and data, the archive separates all fixed length and variable length data. In both cases, it is not necessary, but makes things easier down the line.</p><h3>Archive Format</h3><p>The <code>btar</code> archive is structured as follows:</p><ol type="1"><li><p><strong>Archive Header:</strong> The archive header contains a magic number that identifies the file as a <code>btar</code> archive (the sequence of bytes <code>"\x9a\x00\xA1\xFC""btar"</code>). In addition, it stores when the archive was created, how many files are in it, and the total length of all metadata (that is, all data that is not actual file data).</p></li><li><p><strong>File Metadata Blocks:</strong> After the archive header comes the list of <code>(offset, length)</code> tuples for each file. The number tuples is known from the archive header.</p></li><li><p><strong>File Names:</strong> Next comes all of the file names. They are stored as consecutive NULL terminated strings, and can be of any length.</p></li><li><p><strong>File Data:</strong> Finally, the raw data of every file is concatenated together. There is no separation between the bytes of two files (unlike <code>tar</code>) as the offsets between them are known.</p></li></ol><p>Here is a comment from the top of <code>btar.h</code> giving a visual description of the format.</p><pre><code>/*

If only 32 bit quantities were used, the maximum file size that could be included in an archive would be 4GB, which is not an unreasonable file size any more.</p><h3>Testing</h3><p>To test, I wrote a script that generates 30 files full of random bytes, ranging from 0b to 200KB in size. I archive them all together, unarchive them, and compare the files from the archive to the originals.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p>Here is the API for <code>btar</code></p><pre><code> $ ./btar
btar -- usage

o To create an archive from a set of files:
  &gt; btar pack archive [file1 ... fileN]

o To extract all (or certain) files from an archive:
  &gt; btar unpack archive [file1 ... fileN]

o To view the contents of an archive:
  &gt; btar list archive</code></pre><h3>Example</h3><p>Here is a walkthrough of using the program.</p><pre><code>$ cat {a,b,c,d}.txt

I chose to do the same here. For example, all of the files in an archive have to be in the same directory, and file permissions are not stored. These are "easy" features to add, but the educational value of adding them is small compared to the work they would take. You can conceptually "get" how these things would be done and don't necessarily need to do them yourself if you want to follow along.</p><p>One concession I did not make was skimping out on the 64 bit quantities. Sticking to 32 bit lengths would have made the file format smaller, but would have had a very tangible impact on the max archive size.</p><p>I pointed this out in an earlier section because I think this is a crucial lesson that computer programmers have had to learn the hard way many times (Y2K, 2038 Problem, FAT file system limitations, IPv4 address limitations, early Minecraft world size restriction, ...). We have got to stop doing this to ourselves! A whole class of overflow related bugs disappears when using the full word size of modern processors (ie: 2^32 dollars is a reasonable amount of money while 2^64 dollars is not), and I think we should be leveraging this.</p><p>Partly, I think that the ergonomics of the C language are to blame. For example, the definitions in <code>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code> like <code>uint64_t</code> are quite the mouthful and discourage their own use. It is so much easier to just write <code>for (int i = 0 ...</code> than it is to "do the right thing" and be careful with your types.</p><p>Other languages have fancy keywords like <code>u64</code> that I think would be nice (I guess you could <code>typedef</code> these).</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The simplicity of <code>btar</code> comes mostly from the fact that the file abstraction is so straightforward. Files are just bytes, so many files together are just many bytes together. I am still confused as to why the original <code>tar</code> did not provide random access, maybe someone a little older can clue me in!</p></main><footer>Last modified May 10 15:58:03 2021</footer></body></html>
