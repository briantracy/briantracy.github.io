# Strength, Weakness, and Invisalign

*January 2025*

Despite understanding the harm it does to my teeth and hands, I still bite my fingernails. I never grew out of this nasty habit, and even after hundreds of painful "mishaps" while doing the deed, I still can't completely stop.

I have always attributed this habit to weakness: if I were only stronger, more disciplined, more in control, I would stop biting my nails. This attitude was mildly effective. Months could pass where I would fight with myself and bring to bear the daily focus required to stop biting. During these stretches, I considered my success to be a testament to my strength. I would feel proud knowing that I was doing something hard (for me), that I was in control of myself, and that I alone, through nothing more than blind effort, could put an end to a destructive habit.

Inevitably, I would relapse. When I found myself in a stressful situation (like a test or before a job interview), I would cave and seek out the odd comfort of nail biting. After the fact, I would feel not only the physical pain of yet another self inflicted manicure, but also the mental disappointment of being reminded again that I was weak. Awash in my failure, I would buckle down, make a vow, and begin a brand new iteration of the loop. This cycle continued until I was 24.

The situation completely changed when I got Invisalign. My entire day was now split between periods where I was wearing a plastic covering over my teeth, thus mechanically disabling their nail biting capabilities, or with my teeth unsheathed but so sore that the thought of biting anything as hard as a fingernail was preposterous. In the year that I wore Invisalign, my nail biting was reduced by 99%.
