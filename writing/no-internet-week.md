# No Internet Week

I have procrastination and avoidance issues. These issues get in the way of me doing my schoolwork and other
activities that are good for me (exercising, reading, meditating, ...).

One of the many things that exacerbate these issues is unlimited access to the Internet. It is very easy for me
to avoid work when I can pop open YouTube and escape any mental frustration.

With this in mind, I want to abstain from all non essential Internet usage for a week (essential being defined
as "related to school").

| Day | Notes |
|:---:|:------|
| Sat Mar 27 | I have to fight the urge to open up a new browser tab and distract myself. I am feeling sad and missing the distraction. |
| Sun Mar 28 | Same urges today. Not any easier to do schoolwork. I have been reading when I need to distract myself. |
