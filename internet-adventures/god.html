Also, assume that by forgoing a virtuous life, their suffering is reduced by some amount <code>B</code> (for benefit) because they don't have to go to church, etc.</p><p>Unfortunately for this person, their expected amount of suffering is always going to be huge because the "power of hell" dominates "sleeping in on Sundays".</p><pre><code>E[Suffering] = (1/1000000000)(Infinite) + (1-(1/1000000000))(-B) = Infinite</code></pre><p>The crux of the issue is that because we can't prove that god does not exist (no scientific atheist would ever make such a claim), the possibility of his wrath will always be looming large.</p></main><footer>Last modified Aug 22 23:46:08 2020</footer></body></html>
