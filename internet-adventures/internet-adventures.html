In an effort to convince myself that this time is not wasted, I like to have something to show for it. Every few weeks, I compile a list of the most interesting things I saw online and do a brief writeup. I try to keep these lists as academically diverse as possible in an attempt to not bore my friends who don't care about computer science, but are maybe more interested in things like the physical sciences, art, history, and politics.</p><ol type="1"><li><a href="waves-chips-language.html">Waves, Chips, and Language</a></li><li><a href="maps-cables-pills.html">Maps, Cables, and Pills</a></li></ol></main><footer>Last modified May 17 13:22:46 2020</footer></body></html>
