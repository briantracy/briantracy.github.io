### Ancient Languages
I have always been skeptical of the phrase *"There is no way to say \_\_\_\_ in your language"* because I don't think that there exists a culture on Earth so advanced or different that they have ideas that are simply incomprehensible to other cultures. Obviously, there is not a 1:1 mapping of words between any two languages, however, given enough space, I always believed that you could make a translation between any two languages.

For example, consider a civilization that has not yet invented the clock or a way of telling time. The English word "hour" would not have a corresponding word in their language, but you could teach them what an hour is based on shared physical phenomena (day length, shadow creep, ...). Concepts are universal, specific words are not.

This stack exchange page is interesting because it makes the claim that not only are modern languages all equally expressive, but the languages of thousands of years ago are also comparable.
