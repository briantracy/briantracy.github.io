### Pascal's Wager

How sure are you that god does not exist?

According to Blaise Pascal (1600s), the correct answer is that it doesn't matter, and that you should believe in god anyways.

Rejecting god might make your life easier, but you open yourself up to the possibility (however infinitesimal) of eternal damnation, so the expected value of suffering is very much positive.

```
E[X] = Expected Value of X = p_1*x_1 + ... + p_n*x_n
```

Assuming a hypothetical person is agnostic or atheist (best case scenario for the wager), let's say that they give a one in one billion chance that god exists (this could be as low as they like). Also, assume that by forgoing a virtuous life, their suffering is reduced by some amount `B` (for benefit) because they don't have to go to church, etc.

Unfortunately for this person, their expected amount of suffering is always going to be huge because the "power of hell" dominates "sleeping in on Sundays".

```
E[Suffering] = (1/1000000000)(Infinite) + (1-(1/1000000000))(-B) = Infinite
```

The crux of the issue is that because we can't prove that god does not exist (no scientific atheist would ever make such a claim), the possibility of his wrath will always be looming large.
